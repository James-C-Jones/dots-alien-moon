===========================
I was browsing r/unixporn and saw a rice/background that really caught my eye. This is the result of that.

I thought this was really really cool.  https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/p0b4oh/qtile_light_purple_my_first_time/

I AM MAKING AN INSTALL GUIDE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS BECAUSE OF MY REALLY WEIRD AND WONKY SETTINGS.

**Dependencies**:

* Kitty *(alternatively I can provide color confs for any terminal if requested)*

* Dunst

* Polybar

* Discord

* BetterDiscord

* betterlockscreen

* i3lock-fancy

* i3-gaps

* rofi

* picom-ibhagwan-git

**Other tools I use**:

* Sublime

* Spotify

* Thunar

* Zathura

* Neovim

## Boot 

I provided a grub theme (mostly just colors but hey its consistent with the theme)

If you're not comfortable changing this I wouldn't even bother. It's a bit of a hassle.

## Notes

I recommend going through and changing the "monitor: DP-2" or any variation of this and using "xrandr" to change to your monitor(s).   
I'm super OCD and like my rofi/dunst/polybar to spawn only on one of my monitors. I'm not sure everything you should look at but rofi/polybar/i3 are for sure you should look in the configs. 

I didn't bother saving any screenshots of the previous editon because it wasn't recieved very well.

**Enjoy**
